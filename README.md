## CreditCheck-AI
Credit Card Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

# 📌 Project Overview
CreditCheck AI is a machine learning-based system that predicts whether a credit card application will be approved or rejected based on applicant financial and demographic data.

# 🧠 Problem Statement
Manual credit card approval processes are time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. This project automates approval decisions using machine learning models.

# 📊 Dataset
- Cleaned credit card application dataset
- Features include Age, Income, CreditScore, Debt, Employment status, etc.
- Target variable: Approved (0 = Rejected, 1 = Approved)

# ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

# 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# 🏆 Best Model
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy and was selected as the final model.

# 📈 Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model comparison
- Confusion Matrix
- Prediction for new applicant
  
# 🚀 Future Scope
- Web application using Flask/Django
- Real-time data integration
- Advanced ensemble models
